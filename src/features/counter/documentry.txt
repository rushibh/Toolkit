Redux Toolkit
1> yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit - to download toolkit 
2> yarn add react-redux 
3> 

store file must be inside folder of app  
create store in source Folder which is store.js  . make sure store.js file level must be same package.json file level
4> In store.jsx file => import {configureStore} from '@reduxjs/toolkit'; - configureStore is a function provided by Redux Toolkit that simplifies the process of creating a Redux store in a React application 
// before redux-toolkit we were use it createStore like that import { createStore } from 'redux';
5> export const store = configureStore({
    reducer : {
    }
})

After creating store File we will go for 
6> index.js file =>  import { store } from './store.jsx'
and then in addition we will add  import { Provider } from 'react-redux' which will provide this global state to our app taht come form  'react-redux'
and wrap <Provider store={store} > 
                <App />
        </Provider>
now our store global state will be available  to the app
7> we need to create a features directory inside of our source directory

features > counter > counterSlice.jsx => 
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
now we will create initialState like  /******* reducer.jsx in redux ***** like related ******/

const initialState = {
    count : 0
}
export const counterSlice = createSlice({
    name : "counter",
    initialState,
    reducers : {
        // inside reducer we will able to write some actions like increment and others

        increment : (state) => {
            state.count += 1 // state.count = count + 1
        },
        decrement : (state) => {
            state.count = state.count - 1
        }
    }
})


now we'll destructor those actions so we  have increment   and decrement and  those are destructored from our counterSlice.actions;


export const { increment , decrement  } = counterSlice.actions;

export default  counterSlice.reducer;


okay 
8>
we will create new file is counter in counter directory => 
like useDispatch() and useSelectore() import from 'react-redux'
and with addition we import { increment , decrement} from './../features/counter/counterSlice'
then use it inside button as a anonymus call back function in add call () => dispatch(increment()) same as decrement


important thing when we use useSelectore((state) => state._counters_.count) => this _counters_ from store  remember taht not name from counterSlice
